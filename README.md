# 01-week-refactor
Upon opening the HTML file, there was a quick view that the original author of this code was using non semantic elements throught his code.

Some of these were changed so that we can better understand what is going on in that certain area of the code. 

There were <div> used repeatedly and it made reading the code very hard. <sections> took the place of <div> so that the reader can see that a new chapter or section was being started.

Spacing and indentations were added to make things more clearly.

Alt attributes were added to the <img> files to make them accessible.
